Minimizacao de todo o sistema
&cntrl
  imin   = 1,      ! Minimize the initial structure
  maxcyc = 10000,  ! Maximum number of cycles for minimization 
  ncyc   = 5000,   ! Switch from Steepest Descent to Conjugate Gradient minimization after ncyc cycles
  ntb    = 1,      ! Constant volume
  ntp    = 0,      ! No pressure scaling
  ntr    = 0,      ! No restraints
  ntf    = 1,      ! Complete interaction is calculated
  ntc    = 1,      ! SHAKE is not performed
  ntpr   = 200,    ! Print energy data
  ntwr   = 2000,   ! Write a restart file every ntwr steps
  cut    = 10      ! Nonbonded cutoff in Ansgtroms
